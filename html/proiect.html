            <h1 id="titlu1"><b>1. Chill Wine With Frozen Grapes</b></h1>
            <p>If you want your wine chilled, but don’t want to dilute the flavor, try sticking some frozen grapes in your glass instead of ice cubes.</p>
            <p id="titlu1"><b>2. Finish meetings with 3 questions:</b></p>
            <div>1. What do we need to do now 2.Who’s going to do it and 3. What’s the deadline for this task? Answering these three questions means your meeting has been summarised, and the takeaways are clear. There’s nothing worse than leaving a meeting feeling like you’ve got no where. Answering these three questions means you will.</div>
            <p id="titlu1"><b>3. Make moving to a new city easier for yourself</b></p>
            <div>Learn to say “I am learning the language” instead of “Sorry, I don’t know the language” in the language of the city you are moving to. People are always glad to hear that you are willing to make the effort to learn their language!</div>
            <p id="titlu1"><b>4. Stay on the safer side</b></p>
            <div>Pretend to talk on your phone when taking an auto/cab late night and casually mention that you are travelling in a cab and going by so-and-so route. An extra step you take on a late night cab ride is taking a picture of its registration number and sending it to a family member or friend.</div>
            <p id="titlu1"><b>5. Say goodbye to pesky mosquitoes</b></p>
            <div>Lets face it, mosquitoes are an aggravation.The buzzing, the biting and the itching are enough to send the bravest outdoor lover back into the safety of the house. So if you find yourself in a place plagued with mosquitoes and with no bug repellent on hand, what you can do is ask around for a mentholated pain balm. It works like a charm to keep the pesky mosquitoes away.</div>
            <p id="titlu1"><b>6. Get your stuff back</b></p>
            <div>If you often forget about the stuff you have loaned to others and to whom, this hack is for you. When friends borrows a tool or a beloved book, snap a photo of them holding it. Next time you need something and can’t remember who you gave it too, the photo will help you get it back.</div>
            <p id="titlu1"><b>7. Make breakfast the night before</b></p>
            <div>An incredibly simple but effective hack, that will make your whole day more productive and healthy. It’s actually proven that if you eat a healthy breakfast it means you’re more likely to stick with healthy food and snacks for the rest of the day. It also means you can have a cheeky extra snooze in bed, which is always a good thing!</div>
            <p id="titlu1"><b>8. Follow the two-minute rule</b></p>
            <div>The two minute rule is the perfect procrastination buster that you should definitely start following. If you can finish a task in 2 minutes (such as replying to an email or sending someone a reminder), then do it NOW. Don’t put a 2 minute task off until later.</div>
            <p id="titlu1"><b>9. Turn down your monitor brightness</b></p>
            <div>This is a saviour for anyone who gets very tired eyes from looking at a bright screen for too long. Turning down the brightness will ease eyestrain and allow you to continue working productively without hurting yourself.</div>
            <p id="titlu1"><b>10. Don’t get involved with work politics</b></p>
            <div>It’s an easy mistake to make, but getting involved with work gossip is probably one of the biggest mistakes you can make. It adds unnecessary stress into the work environment. So do yourself a favour and distance yourself from any gossip.</div>
